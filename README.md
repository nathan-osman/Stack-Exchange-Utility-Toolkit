## Overview

The goal of this project is to provide a set of scripts that abstract common functionality away from UserScripts written for Stack Exchange sites.

Functionality is grouped into sets of classes that make it easy to develop UserScripts from scratch - no need to worry about CSS classes being renamed or elements being moved around the page.
